# 1XA3-Final-Project


Final Project for 2014 1XA3 class at McMaster University. 

Generates a random perfect maze of variable size and randomly places a key somewhere within. Traverses the maze to find the path from the start to the key, then the path from the key to exit.

Maze.py by me, graphics.py included for displaying the maze
